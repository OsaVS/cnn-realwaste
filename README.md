# ‚ôªÔ∏è RealWaste Image Classification

This project focuses on classifying real-world waste materials using the **RealWaste** dataset.  
The dataset contains authentic landfill images of various waste types such as plastic, glass, metal, and paper.  
By training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project aims to develop an accurate and practical AI model for automated waste classification under real landfill conditions.

## üìö Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify real-world waste images from the RealWaste dataset.
Unlike clean, studio waste images, RealWaste contains photos taken directly at landfills, making it ideal for developing AI models that work in real conditions.
The goal is to automatically identify the type of material (e.g., plastic, metal, glass) to support smarter and more efficient waste management.

## üß† Dataset: RealWaste

The **RealWaste dataset** contains **color images of waste items** captured directly at a landfill site.  
Each image is labeled according to the material type it represents.

**Classes (9 total):**
- Cardboard  
- Food Organics  
- Glass  
- Metal  
- Miscellaneous Trash  
- Paper  
- Plastic  
- Textile Trash  
- Vegetation  

**Image Details:**
- Resolution: 524 √ó 524 pixels  
- Total Images: ~4,000  
- Format: JPG / PNG
